# My Portfolio  

Welcome to my portfolio, a space where I showcase my skills, creativity, and passion for design and development.  

## Design Process  

The design for this portfolio was inspired by the minimalist aesthetic commonly found in art museums. I sought to create an experience where each element has room to breathe, allowing the visuals to take center stage. Similar to how a museum might display a singular piece of artwork as the focal point, the design allows for a seamless transition between sections while keeping the emphasis on the content.  

The primary color scheme is black, ensuring that the visuals stand out, with a carefully selected accent color for contrast. The initial design was created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/hEFzUug7bx6ODKx8qU0Y6S/Portfoilo?node-id=5-2&t=uAGAgzxvSODTRBLf-1), before being brought to life through code.
