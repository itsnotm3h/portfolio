# My portfoilo
Welcome to a space where i can showcase my skills and creativiy.
<br/><br/>

## Design Process
I was inspired by the effective use of space in art museums and aimed to recreate that effect with a minimalist design. I drew inspiration from how art museums often display a single artwork as the centerpiece, with other paintings guiding viewers to the next section. 

I chose black as the primary color to ensure the focus remains on the colors of the visuals, using one additional color for contrast. I initially created the design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/hEFzUug7bx6ODKx8qU0Y6S/Portfoilo?node-id=5-2&t=uAGAgzxvSODTRBLf-1) before translating it into code.
